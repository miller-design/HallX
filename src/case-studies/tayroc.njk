	In 2014, the owners of Tayroc set out to create “a timepiece that was a stylish, affordable and true representation
	of its wearer”. Fast forward a few years and after achieving growth, the scaling business began to experience problems
	which led to dissatisfied customers. Gemma Noble stepped on the scene after seeing an opportunity in the brand and made
	it her mission to turn things around.

	Tayroc’s previous customer service team member began to fail and this resulted in late orders and ignored communications. 
	To add to this, their fulfilment centre stopped fulfilling orders. This resulted in customer satisfaction plummeting and 
	a Trustpilot rating of 2.8/5. The business also had issues with packaging and other problems causing product failures.
