	Are you an EU Webshop selling into the UK, struggling with customs complications post-brexit? We can help.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Clients outside of the UK are able to consign cartons/pallets/LTL/Full Truckloads of pre-labelled packages 
	to us which we then inject into the UK system. This is ideal for international brands and EU stores, experiencing 
	difficulties due to Brexit.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	We can already offer this service to brands with or without a UK VAT registration under our HMRC Fulfilment House 
	Due Diligence Scheme programme. If you are looking for simplified customs clearance with pre-negotiated final mile 
	delivery in the UK, look no further than HallX, we can often arrive in the country cheaper than a direct courier, 
	in the same time, but pre-cleared for taxes and duty with no hidden fees or charges for your end customer.
