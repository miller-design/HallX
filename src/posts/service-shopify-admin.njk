	We can undertake your Shopify admin tasks on an ad-hoc or pay as you go basis. This can be anything 
	from updating your shipping options once a week so that your Saturday delivery option only shows on 
	the Friday, to helping you change the details sections in all of your product listings when you 
	realise your listings are no longer compliant. 
	<br/>
	<br/>
	As a free service included in all our monthly plans, we can also summarise any ‘high risk’ transactions 
	on your store. We don’t make the decisions for you, but we do consolidate information to make it a 
	much easier process for you. Instead of spending your valuable time looking through data, you can make 
	an easy decision based on the summary we provide. 
	<br/>
	<br/>
	We’re able to administrate practically any aspect of a Shopify or wooCommerce site that is a difficulty 
	for you, if you have a task you’re just sick of doing, why not contact us below and see what we can do 
	for you? Consultations are free and you have no obligation to take us up on any offer if you decide it’s 
	not quite right for you.
