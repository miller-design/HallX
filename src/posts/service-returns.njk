	We can manage your returns process for you and reconsolidate them to make the returns process easier for customers 
	and save you up to 20% vs processing case-by-case. 
	<br/>
	<br/>
	We work with Royal Mail in the UK to provide a printer-free returns service with thousands of locations all across 
	the UK to allow your customers an easy and simple return experience. We can also help process the returns for your 
	EU customers with local return addresses in Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany and France.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	We also have a global solution (coming very soon) which offers the same benefits, meaning that a customer in South Africa 
	can send a domestic printer-free return at their local post office and we can have that return confirmed in two days and 
	get a resolution for your customer rapidly. This avoids the usual 15 day wait for the package to come back from South Africa, 
	and then time spent assessing the return. With our solution we can get that package back in the air on day 3 for a superior 
	customer experience.
